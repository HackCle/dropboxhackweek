They will impact the city of Cleveland, Ohio and in the future, whatever city would like to replicate the projects. Your time is appreciated above measure.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Clarity\r\nThese projects came out of the [FIX 216 Civic Hackathon](http://www.hackcleveland.org/events/2015/3/28/fix-216) and we've had a couple follow up meetings since the event to make sure all information is up-to-date and organized.
